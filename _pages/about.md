I’m a final year Information Systems student at Singapore Management University (SMU), with a second major in Quantitative Finance. My passion lies at the intersection of technology and finance.

Currently, I’m a Research Assistant at SMU, focusing on leveraging quantum computing to predict market anomalies. My work aims to bring theoretical advancements into practical financial applications.

Outside of academics, I enjoy working on personal tech-finance projects. I also find joy in volleyball and music. 

I’m always looking to connect with others and explore innovative solutions in the financial sector. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aldennghjz/) or email at [aldenhjz@gmail.com](mailto:aldenhjz@gmail.com)
